millimeter wave spectrum: Refers to a new band of frequencies that wireless
technology manufactures are expirementing with in order to overcome the satuartion
that exists on historiccally used wirless frequency bands. These waves are 
typically broadcast between 30 and 300 GHz


Multi-Access Edge Computing
% source https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/what-is-multi-access-edge-computing
The practice of placing computing infrastructure physically closer to the end user to 
gain ultra-low latency. "Edge" refers to the fact that these systems are not necessary
to core infrastructure i.e. systems built with edge infrastructure are simply there to
boost a system's responsivness.

%paragraph
AT\&T is colloborating with the University of Tennesse, Knoxville (U.T.) to bring millimeter wave spectrum
(5G+) cell technology and Multi-Access Edge Computing to the University Campus. AT\&T claims this will have major 
implications for the region and beyond : inspire agricultural innovation, enhance academic experiences, and provide "warfighters"
the ability to "see through" walls. Farmer's can leverage this increased connectivity to boost 
their real time insights into their "soil and crop health".
Students at UT  can participate in 5G+ enabled learning experiences with both
augmented reality and virtualy reality.These digital experiences 
can emulate dangerous or impractical scenarios that could be potential useful
for education e.g. touring a Nuclear Power Plant.  
Additionally, AT&T noted that the 5G+ infrastructure
will enable machine learning algorithms to sift through students' class engagement and biometric data to evaluate performance and optimize the learning experience for the student.
The military hopes to utilize the millimeter spectrum with radar technology. This application would allows the militants to take pictures through walls and communicate
that information to allies. Overall,
AT/&T and a cross functional team of professors at U.T.
will research, expiriment, and test a real world implementation of
5G+ and Multi-Access Edge Computing Technology.

% \subsection*{Personal Thoughts}
% Overall, I feel this net benefit to society; Enabling enhanced connectivity can be incredibly beneificial for a rural area.
% Some potential impact areas that were listed did raise some red flags.
% Utilizing this technology to analyze student biometric data immidietly triggers privacy concerns. The intention, personalizing learning experience,
% seems not immeditely related. 

\section*{NFC Textiles}

Near Field Communication (NFC)
%source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication
Inductive coupling based technology which allows for contactless exchange of data over <2cm. 
It utilizes the frequency 13.56 MHz to interface at data rates between 106-424 kbit/s.


%article source : https://www.rfidjournal.com/researchers-develop-smart-furniture-with-flexible-nfc
Carnegie Mellon's WiTech Lab are expirementing with variations of a Near Field Communication (NFC) reading system.
Traditionally, NFC systems have a wireless range of <2cm; WiTech's system utilizes a "beamforming" algorithm
which allows their detection system to have a range of 20cm.
Benefitting from this range, their system allows 3D "localization" of NFC tags and other conductive objects. 
This localization elaborates the 3D position and
postures of these objects.
Their initial application of WiTech's expirimentation is to have a couch equipped with textile 
antennae and use it as a long range NFC detector. 
With this information in this application, their system can identify someone's posture e.g lying down 
or sitting on a couch.
WiTech's technique uses a "blind beamforming" algorithm to detect conductive object that are 
not NFT tags. More sophisiticated alogorithms could be utlized with NFT tags that could
allow for users to be identified or smart home actions to be triggered. WiTech's team iterates that
further optimizations can be performed to enhance the system. Namely, 
increasing the 20cm range and implementing a 
form of encryption for bolster the system's security.



\section*{Shielding Ultracold Molecules with Microwaves}


%article source https://phys.org/news/2021-08-shielding-ultracold-molecules-microwaves.html
Quantum technologies like quantum computing and quantum simulation 
utilize so called "ultracold molecules". 
A key drawback to these molecules is that molecule-molecule
collision effectively eliminates these molecules' effectiveness.
Reducing these collisions is one of the paramount challenges that 
quantum technology needs to overcome in order to be useful.
An international team of researchers has shown that these collisions
can be reduced by "guiding the interaction between molecules using
microwaves". These dipole moments of these molecules have 2 major practical interactions.
They can oscillate with lab exposed microwaves and adjacent molecules can interact with one another
causing repulsion or attraction. With these interactions, the researchs engineered a method
to repel individual calcium monofluoried molecules that at 100 $\mu$K. This reduced the collisions 
and associated loss rate six fold. Furthermore, this microwave "shielding" 
has been show to boost elastic collistions 17-fold. These elastic collisions 
are beneficial for further cooling making the goal of a ultracold molecule
gas even closer to realization.
